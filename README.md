# Bootstrap Theme Machine

## A collection of stylized Bootstrap Themes by HackerThemes

This project includes all the free and open source Bootstrap themes on HackerThemes.com. Each folder under `/dist/` is it's own theme, which includes a small starter template as well.

## Getting started

You can either clone this entire repository and use the themes under `/dist/`, or head download the [Bootstrap themes](https://hackerthemes.com) individually on our website.

## Build steps

Original project used 'gulp-scss-lint' which required Ruby to run. So I've removed it.

To build and modify the themes, you'll need to use npm and gulp. You'll also need Ruby and scss-lint. On Ubuntu (and hopefully other systems :-) you can do:

1. `yarn build` to run the build
